1 of the 4 guys in fact did not die

Got away from the persuers

Ran north in North Town

High Elves created pyramid schemes (Vandas) - knifes

Gorin is suseptable to pyramid schemes
Gorin has never played a games before (until today) - made money

Met Gili the bar keep

Derek fought frogs that were supposed to be large mice that almost killed him. Was saved by Gili.
Gili- "Its not Christian"

And got 1 week of free stay

Vandus had a rough childhood

Vandus stole 2 random books

Gorin stole one book and tore it up because it was plagerized from his own work.

Poor gnome guy had a heart attack and died after Gorin stole and destroyed a book (his stolen works) and ran off.

I was left with the body to deal with and have left the tavern, to go ????

Leveled up to lvl 2

I want to take level 2 as Arificier but I haven't really learned anything about the hammer or done anything about my backstory. When I had the near death experience, nightmares about the day I died and remembering what my people were kind of like. The special objects that were around. And the hammer thats just been chilling in my backpack during my travels as a vampire.
