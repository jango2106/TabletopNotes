## Feats
### Combat

**Unnatural Vitality**
  - When you drop to 0 hit point, you may choose to stay conscious instead of falling unconscious. If you do, you gain tem hit points equal to character level. In this state, you may take an action or bonus action on your turn, but not both, and you make death saving throws at the end of your turn as usual. you can remain in this state until you fail your first death saving throw (at which point you fall unconcious and continue making death saving throws until you stabilize or regain additional hit points) or die outright to massive damage. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

**Hexblade's Curse**
  - You gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:

    - You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.

    - Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

    - If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

    - You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Hex Warrior**
  - You acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.
  - The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.

### Passive

**Eternal Vengence**
  - At all time you know the general direction of and relative distance to a create of the DMs choosing against whom you seek revenge for your death, even if this creature and you are on different planes of existence. Should this create die by your hand or that of another, you instantly know and you DM chooses another create also responsible for your death for this feature to apply to, should such creature exist.

**Otherworldly Patron**
  - You have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Fiend, which is detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
