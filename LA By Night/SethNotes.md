# Second Session - March 7, 2019

## Events
* Take the bus home after the rant
  * See a few public masturbators, NBD
* Receive a text message from 155-203-7979 (AKA Jonny Finn)
  * Thanks me for my help the previous evening, they are surprised we can put up such a good fight
  * Asks us to come meet at Club Devour
  * If the club scene isn't our thing, SouthGate Pawn
* We all agree to meet at SouthGate Pawn, get an address
* We show up at the pawn shop
  * Tidus and I acknowledge each other, don't say anything
  * I hang out in the Adult section, James joins me
  * Pick up giant dildo bat, considering purchasing
  * Compel the guy behind the counter to give me the dildo bat for free
* Go meet Jonny
  * Asked to *remove* 5 people from SouthGate
  * Aden, Terrance, Kingsley, Romeo, Marcus
  * Take the job, we are offered 1 major boon together or 2 minor boons each
  * Can't talk about this at all, should look like an accident or just go completely unnoticed
* Seth stands around awkwardly while Jim and Tidus call their contacts to try and get information
  * Tidus doesn't get much, but Jim informs us all about their awfulness. Seth is pissed about someone using kids to run drugs
  * We try to find them using Facebook (modern problems require modern solutions)
  * Marcus basically dropped off the face of the earth about 3 years ago, safe to assume he's been a vamp for about that long
* Find an address for Downtown, decide to go there
* Meet a homeless guy, learn somebody named Kingsley shows up in a white van around 1:00am
* We construct a terrible plan to jump these people
  * I jump from the southwest building onto a body guard and beam him in the head with my dildo bat
  * We fucking destroy the 3 guys outside the van - I headbutt one to death
  * Yank who we believe is Kingsley out of the van and try to stake him - miss
  * Stake him finally, throw him in the van, clean up the scene and drive away

## Equipment
* Dildo bat
* Stake

## Notes
* SouthGate is a terrible place, like Anaheim except with even fewer innocent people

    <dt>Ghouls</dt>
    <dd>Humans who have been fed vampire blood. They are gross, but they live forever, don't get sick, etc.</dd>
    <dt>Boons</dt>
    <dd>A boon is a favor. These are currency for vampires - living forever makes physical money hold no real value, but favors are fantastic. DO NOT SKIP OUT ON A BOON, YOU WILL BE LABELED AN OATH BREAKER AND YOU WILL GET SHIT ON FOREVER.</dd>
